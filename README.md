# Predicting-House-Prices-USA-Real-Estate-
This repository contains Python code for predicting house prices in the USA real estate market using various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge CV, and ElasticNet CV. The data used in the analysis is from a public dataset and includes information. about the, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, acre lot, zip code, house size, and price. 

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations of the data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation steps. Each model is trained and evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²).

The results of the analysis indicate that Random Forest has the best performance among the models with an R² score of 0.72 and a relatively low RMSE score of 0.52. The other models also perform well, with R² scores ranging from 0.55 to 0.64. 

if you think this repository can serve as a useful reference for anyone interested in predicting house prices using machine learning techniques and can be a good starting point for further research in this area. you can up vote for me in kaggle notebook
